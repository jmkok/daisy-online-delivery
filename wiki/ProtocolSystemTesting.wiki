#summary A report on the testing of the DAISY Online protocol against the requirements and expectations.
#labels Phase-Requirements,Phase-QA,Report

<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />

= Introduction =

This report summarizes the system testing of the protocol, that is, the demonstration of how well the specification fulfils the requirements and expectations.  The requirements come from the modified RequirementsDocument.

Note that this is not conformance testing.  Some of these test will not be met even by some conformant Reading Systems and Services.  Rather, they are proofs-of-concept, demonstrations that the protocol can support a particular function.  For example, test 14.3 "Pre-requisite book" states:

  Search for the second or third book of a series, where the previous book was never issued. The Service should, in the dynamic menus, inform the user of the previous book.

This only applies to Services that support dynamic menus, searching and have the optional function of tracking a User's previous selections and making suggestions.  Not all Services are expected to do this.

_Example of how this should be filled out_

|| Test case || Client || Server || Result || Details ||
|| 1.1 || XXX || YYY || *Success* || Transfer of data was at expected rates for binary transfer over the Internet.  A 119 MB book was downloaded in 26 minutes. ||
|| 1.1 || XXX || YYY || *Success* || Transfer of data was at expected rates for binary transfer over the Internet.  An X MB book was downloaded in Y minutes. ||
|| 1.3 || XXX || YYY || *Failure* || Transfer of data was at X% efficiency compared to binary transfer.  Audio of Y MB was uploaded in Z minutes. ||

= Requirements =

== 1. Efficient use of bandwidth ==

*Partially fulfilled*

[RequirementsDocument#Efficient_use_of_bandwidth Requirement]

Content transfer usually takes place over HTTP, which is sufficient for transfer of data over the World Wide Web.  The Service creates minimal overhead.

Transfer of audio from the Reading System to the Service takes place over SOAP without MTOM, which adds roughly 37% more to transmission time.

  # *Download content*: Use a Service to find and download an entire Content item.  Ensure that the Content is downloaded in a reasonable amount of time.
  # *Protocol overhead*: In a typical session, measure the ratio of bytes transferred for messages (i.e., over SOAP) vs. bytes transferred for Content (i.e., over plain HTTP/HTTPS).
  # *Audio response*: Send an audio response to a dynamic menu item that supports it.  Ensure that the audio is uploaded in a reasonable amount of time.

== 2. Key authorization ==

*Partially fulfilled*

[RequirementsDocument#Key_authorization Requirement]

Authorization occurs by User, not by Reading System; credentials are user names and passwords, not encryption keys. Service Providers intending to authorize Content by individual Reading System will need to use some other mechanism, such as PDTB2.

  # *Connect with authorization*: Initialize a session with a Service using correct user credentials.
  # *Deny incorrect authorization*: Attempt to initialize a session with a Service using a valid user name, but an incorrect password.  The Service must respond `false` to the `logOn` operation, and return a `NoActiveSession` fault to subsequent operation calls.
  # *Allow content download with correct credentials*: Download a resource with basic authentication credentials provided by the Service.
  # *Deny content download with incorrect credentials*: Attempt to download a resource with incorrect basic authentication credentials.  The file server must respond with an HTTP status of "401 Unauthorized".

== 3. Transmit bookmarks ==

*Partially fulfilled*

[RequirementsDocument#Transmit_bookmarks Requirement]

The protocol does not support bookmarks with audio notes.

Note: Storing user-created bookmarks is covered under requirement #13, Bookmark stored on server.

*Untested*

[RequirementsDocument#Return_book Requirement]

  # *Return a downloaded book*: Issue and download a Borrowable Content item (i.e. one that requires return) then perform the Reading System's return function.  The Service must return `true`.  Verify that the Content's resources have been removed from the Reading System.
  # *Return a streamed book*: Issue a Borrowable Content item and stream some part of it, then perform the Reading System's return function.  The Service must return `true`.  Verify that the Content's resources are not present on the Reading System.

*Untested*

[RequirementsDocument#Transmit_capabilities Requirement]

  # *Set Reading System attributes*: Initialize a session with a Service.  Verify that the Reading System's attributes were sent to the Service.
  # *Adapt Content to the Reading System's capabilities*: Initialize a session with a Service that provides different Content based on the capabilities of the Reading System.  Ensure that the Content and resources offered by the Service are only in the formats given in the `readingSystemAttributes` provided to the Service.
  # *Negotiate audio labels*: Initialize a session with a Service that supports text-only and text+audio labels.  Set `readingSystemAttributes/config/requiresAudioLabels` to `true` when calling `setReadingSystemAttributes`.  Ensure that all `label`s have `audio` components.
  # *Negotiate numeric input*: Initialize a session with a Service that has implemented both numeric and alphanumeric `inputQuestion`s.  Set `readingSystemAttributes/config/supportedInputTypes` to to have one `input` element with a `type` attribute of `TEXT_NUMERIC` when calling `setReadingSystemAttributes`.  Ensure that all `inputQuestion`s allow `TEXT_NUMERIC` input.

== 7. Player stores contact information ==

*N/A*

[RequirementsDocument#Player_stores_contact_information Requirement]

*Untested*

[RequirementsDocument#Content_at_different_location Requirement]

  # *Public remote content*: Issue a Content item which is hosted on a public server that is not affiliated with the Service Provider and does not require authentication.  Download the Content.

*Not fulfilled*

[RequirementsDocument#Report_download_activity Requirement]

The capability for a Reading System to report its own download activity to the Service was not included in the protocol.  Service Providers may track this information for local Content by monitoring their own file servers, and may need to require Service Delegates to report download activity.

Although reporting download activity is not part of the protocol, certain organizations still need to track it.  This can usually be done on the file server, using standard logging tools.

  # *Track downloads*: Connect to a Service, then issue and download a Content item.  Verify that file downloads were logged by the Service Provider.

*Untested*

The ability to retrieve short announcements for such things as service interruptions and overdue reminders was dropped from the formal requirements, but is still part of the specification.

  # *Get announcements*: Connect to a Service, then get a list of announcements using the `getServiceAnnouncements` operation and render them.
  # *Mark as read*: Call the `markAnnouncementsAsRead` operation with the IDs of active announcements.  Call the `getServiceAnnouncements` operation and ensure that the Service has removed them from the list.

This expands on requirement 26, "Localized, plain language error messages".

  # *Localized announcements*: Connect to a multilingual Service.  Specify in `readingSystemAttributes/config/preferredUILanguage` one of the languages supported by the Service.  Retrieve announcemetns with `getServiceAnnouncements`.  Check that all `label`s have the same language in their `xml:lang` attributes and that the text and audio are in that language.
  # *Localized menus*: Connect to a multilingual Service.  Specify in `readingSystemAttributes/config/preferredUILanguage` one of the languages supported by the Service.  Browse the menu structure using `getQuestions`.  Check that all `label`s have the same language in their `xml:lang` attributes and that the text and audio are in that language.
