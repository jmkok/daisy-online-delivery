= Introduction =

This report summarizes the system testing of the protocol, that is, the demonstration of how well the specification fulfils the requirements and expectations.  The requirements come from the modified RequirementsDocument.

= Requirements =

== Efficient use of bandwidth ==

_Example of how this should be filled out_

*Partially fulfilled*

Content transfer usually takes place over HTTP, which is sufficient for transfer of data over the World Wide Web.  The Service creates minimal overhead.

Transfer of audio from the Reading System to the Service takes place over SOAP without MTOM, which adds roughly 37% more to transmission time.

|| Test case || Client || Server || Result || Details ||
|| [ProtocolSystemTestingTestCases#Download_content Download content] || CNIB || !PratSam || *Success* || Transfer of data was at expected rates for binary transfer over the Internet.  A 119 MB book was downloaded in 26 minutes. ||
|| [ProtocolSystemTestingTestCases#Audio_response Audio response] || XXX || YYY || *Failure* || Transfer of data was at X% efficiency compared to binary transfer.  Audio of Y MB was uploaded in Z minutes. ||

== Key authorization ==

*Partially fulfilled*

Authorization occurs by User, not by Reading System. Service Providers intending to authorize Content by individual Reading System will need to use some other mechanism, such as PDTB2.

== Transmit bookmarks ==

*Untested*

== Return book ==

== Transmit capabilities ==

*Untested*

== Universal protocol ==

*Untested*

|| Test case || Client || Server || Result || Details ||

== Player stores contact information ==

*N/A*

The requirement states that the Reading System must store the Service's contact information.  This is not a requirement as much as it is a declaration that Service Discovery is out of scope.

|| Test case || Client || Server || Result || Details ||

== Content at different location ==

*Untested*

|| Test case || Client || Server || Result || Details ||

== Time interrogation ==

*Not fulfilled*

The ability for Reading Systems to query the Service for the current time was not included in the protocol.

== Download and streaming ==

*Untested*

== Same book, different player ==

== Bookmark stored on server ==

== Interact with content ==

*Untested*

== Report firmware version ==

*Untested*

|| Test case || Client || Server || Result || Details ||

== Report download activity ==

*Not fulfilled*

The capability for a Reading System to report its own download activity to the Service was not included in the protocol.  Service Providers may track this information for local Content by monitoring their own file servers.

== Report player errors ==

*Not fulfilled*

The capability for a Reading System to report errors to the Service was not included in the protocol.

== Report which server is in control ==

*Not fulfilled*

The capability to report which server is in control was not included in the protocol.

== Protect user privacy ==

*Untested*

|| Test case || Client || Server || Result || Details ||

== Localized, plain language error messages ==

*Untested*

|| Test case || Client || Server || Result || Details ||

= Expectations =

== Audio feedback ==

Sending audio from the Reading System to the Service was originally in scope, then declared out of scope, then was brought back into the specification.

|| Test case || Client || Server || Result || Details ||

= Conclusion =

Of the 26 in-scope requirements, X were fulfilled and Y were partially fulfilled.  Z requirements were left unfulfilled, largely due to time constraints.
