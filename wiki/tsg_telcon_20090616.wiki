Kenny posted scripts for non-MTOM testing. Hiro as successfully downloaded using this.

Kenny: the complete query string is in the content metadata fragment.

Kenny: is it possible for a reading system to resume a download?

Hiro: I think we need to modify implementation to do this, but it should work.

Jelle seems to be having trouble getting byte offsets. 

Geoff: the headers are sent to the webserver as a request. Inspect the request object for the range header. 

Kenny: in IIS you can register extensions, perhaps thats the way to do it there. 

Kenny: I could modify my script to return the headers that Jelle requested. A very simple setup using an ASP.NET script. Do we need more time?

Kenny: if we drop MTOM, this will impact approx 8 types. 

Geoff: yes, all these types would need to be changed. 

Kenny: URIs will need to be supplied instead of embedding binary content.
