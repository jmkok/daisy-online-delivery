Regrets: 

== Action Item Summary ==
 
=== New Action Items ===

=== Previous Unfinished Action Items ===
  * Jelle: propose resolution to Issue 118
  * Geoff and Markus analyze RequirementsDocument vs current API. {ONGOING}

== Agenda/Minutes ==

Target: solve the below and distribute action items to implement changes

=== Faults ===
  * Add a dedicated fault when invoking an operation when session has expired? 
    * (Is a fault code embedded in invalidOperationFault an alternative?)
  * expanding the Fault documentation prose - who?


=== Borrow/Return ===
Matt: 
 In addition to the other todo remarks in the Content Return section, 
 the only mention  made in the specification about borrowing content 
 is one sentence in this return section.
 
 The section should probably be renamed to "Lending Content" and have 
 subsections for borrowing and returning. And be moved into 5.4.


=== Return date ===

  * Do we need an explicit return date in contentMetadata (when @requiresReturn=true)


=== Normative/Informative ===
Matt: 
 One thing I have noticed is some inconsistency in applying the 
 normative/informative designation on chapters/sections. Would be 
 good to have someone in the group go through after I'm done and 
 re-apply those consistently to whatever scheme the group wants 
 to use for them.

=== Service Models ===

Keep/remove? If removed, spec needs to be generalized.


=== Reading System Conformance Requirements ===
  * Section still marked as TODO. How to approach this?


=== Terminology ===
Matt: 
 So, to be 100% sure we're on the same page. Operations are 
 operations. Primary types are types. Then all the
 elements/attributes in the element reference section will 
 be referred to by their xml types?

=== Move Appendix B to separate informative dynamic menus primer ===
