== Agenda/Minutes ==

=== Suggestion for an addition of a note to Section 4.7.6 ===

Nick: Should we add a note to section 4.7.6 explaining that support for the three reserved question ids should be declared in serviceAttributes - supportsServerSideBack, supportsSearch and supportedOptionalOperations | operation | DYNAMIC_MENUS

	=== Suggestion for a cosmetic change to section 4.3.2 ====

Kenny: Section 4.3.2 (Browse content selection method) reads:
"...declares support for the Browse Content Selection Method in the supportedContentSelectionMethods service attribute..."

and Section 4.3.1 (Out-of-band selection method) reads:
"...declares support for the Out-of-band Content Selection Method in the supportedContentSelectionMethods element of its serviceAttributes..." 

Although cosmetic, I propose we make the verbiage consistent across both sections.
