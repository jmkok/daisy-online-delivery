=== Best Western Roehampton ===
http://book.bestwestern.com/bestwestern/productInfo.do?propertyCode=66068

(this is walking distance if you accept a 30 minute walk), otherwise it's maybe a 10 dollar cab ride.

=== Crowne Plaza Don Valley ===

A bit further out, maybe a 15 dollar cab ride.

For those looking for restaurants in the area, the Best Western has much more variety close by.
