#summary The test cases used for the protocol system testing.
#labels Phase-QA,In-progress

= Introduction =

These are the test cases for system testing of the protocol.  Some of these may overlap with ones in the [tsg_test_suite implementation conformance test suite].

= Requirements =

== Efficient use of bandwidth ==

=== Download content ===

Use a Service to find and download an entire Content item.  Ensure that the Content is downloaded in a reasonable amount of time.

=== Protocol overhead ===

In a typical session, measure the ratio of bytes transferred for messages (i.e., over SOAP) vs. bytes transferred for Content(i.e., over plain HTTP/HTTPS).

=== Audio response ===

Send an audio response to a dynamic menu item that supports it.  Ensure that the audio is uploaded in a reasonable amount of time.
