#summary Interoperability test cases for both Reading Systems and Services.
#labels Phase-QA,Phase-Implementation,Report

= Introduction =

This report summarizes the interoperability testing of the protocol, that is, the demonstration of independent compatible implementations of each feature in the specification.  These test cases are not comprehensive; in particular, the underlying technologies are not tested.

= Variables =

To allow for testing with existing Reading Systems and Services, variables are given in _italics_ that may be assigned appropriate values when carrying out the tests.

= Preconditions =

An active session established between the Reading System and the Service is a precondition of every test below except those in sections 4.2.1 and 5.1.1.

Preconditions for individual tests are marked (PRE:).

== 5.1. Required Operations ==

=== 5.1.1. The `logOn` Operation ===

Variables
  * _user_: A valid username on the Service.
  * _goodpass_: _user_'s password.
  * _badpass_: A string which is not _user_'s password.

  # *Valid log on*: The RS connects to the Service.  The RS calls `logOn(`_user_`, `_goodpass_`)`.  The Service returns `true` and sets a session cookie.
  # *Invalid log on*: The RS connects to the Service.  The RS calls `logOn(`_user_`, `_badpass_`)`.  The Service returns `false`.

=== 5.1.2. The `logOff` Operation ===

  # *Log off*: The RS calls `logOff()`.  The Service returns `true`.

=== 5.1.3. The `setReadingSystemAttributes` Operation ===

=== 5.1.4. The `issueContent` Operation ===

=== 5.1.5. The `getContentMetadata` Operation ===

=== 5.1.6. The `getContentResources` Operation ===

=== 5.1.7. The `getServiceAttributes` Operation ===

=== 5.1.8. The `getContentList` Operation ===

Variables
  * _listId_: The identifier of a `contentList` on the Service that is not "new", "issued" or "expired".
  * _first_: The index of a `contentItem` in the _listId_ `contentList`.
  * _last_: The index of a `contentItem` in the _listId_ `contentList`, greater than _first_.

  # *New items*: (PRE: The Service supports Out-of-band Content selection.) The RS calls `getContentList("new", 0, -1)`.  The Service returns a `contentList` with the identifier `new`.  No `contentItem`'s `id` is the identifier of an issued Content item.
  # *Issued items*: (PRE: The Service offers some Content under a lending model.) The RS calls `getContentList("issued", 0, -1)`.  The Service returns a `contentList` with the identifier `issued`.  Each `contentItem`'s `id` is the identifier of an issued Content item.
  # *Expired items*: (PRE: The Service provides the "expired" `contentList`.) The RS calls `getContentList("expired", 0, -1)`.  The Service returns a `contentList` with the identifier `expired`.  Each `contentItem`'s `id` is the identifier of an issued Content item.
  # *Browse items*: (PRE: The Service supports Browse Content selection.) The RS calls `getContentList(`_listId_`, 0, -1)`.  The Service returns a `contentList` with the identifier _listId_.
  # *Segmented list*: (PRE: The Service supports Browse Content selection.) The RS calls `getContentList(`_listId_`, `_first_`, `_last_`)`.  The Service returns a `contentList` with the identifier _listId_.
