== Agenda/Minutes ==

=== PDTB2 support in Daisy Online ===

Do we have consensus?

=== Issue 188, 190, 201 and 203 ===

Can we close all these four issues now?

=== Suggestion to move minOccurs and maxOccurs attributes to the parent sequence element in the xsd to deal with an svcutil issue ===

==== Discussion on the list ====

Simon: There is an issue with svcutil when trying to generate code for “array” element.  

There are 3 places (announcements, userResponses and read) in do-types-10.xsd where an element is defined with a single item element that as the maxOccurs=”unbounded” set. This translate into a type that is an array of items.

Moving the minOccurs and maxOccurs to the parent <xs:sequence ...> tag seems to solve the issue. And it’s still translated into the same type since there is only one element in the sequence. 

Here’s what I propose:

Before:

<xs:element name="announcements">

    <xs:complexType>

        <xs:sequence>

            <xs:element name="announcement" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded">

                ...

            </xs:element>

        </xs:sequence>

    </xs:complexType>

</xs:element>

 

<xs:element name="userResponses">

    <xs:complexType>

        <xs:sequence>

            <xs:element name="userResponse" minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="unbounded">

                ...

            </xs:element>

        </xs:sequence>

    </xs:complexType>

</xs:element>

<xs:element name="read">

    <xs:complexType>

        <xs:sequence>

            <xs:element ref="item" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>

        </xs:sequence>

    </xs:complexType>

</xs:element>

After:

<xs:element name="announcements">

    <xs:complexType>

        <xs:sequence minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded">

            <xs:element name="announcement">

                ...

            </xs:element>

        </xs:sequence>

    </xs:complexType>

</xs:element>

 

<xs:element name="userResponses">

    <xs:complexType>

        <xs:sequence minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="unbounded">

            <xs:element name="userResponse">

                ...

            </xs:element>

        </xs:sequence>

    </xs:complexType>

</xs:element>

 

<xs:element name="read">

    <xs:complexType>

        <xs:sequence minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded">

            <xs:element ref="item"/>

        </xs:sequence>

    </xs:complexType>

</xs:element>
 
From what I understand, this is a bug with Microsoft tool and not with the xsd. But since both form are valid, I suggest we make the change.

Johan: Doesn't work with my tools. 

I think we should keep the syntax consistent. Mixing things up in schemas gives an impression of a sloppy work. Since Microsoft's tool seems to understand array elements for other types I think it would be better to report this issue to Microsoft and let them to fix the bug.

Kenny, do you also have the same problem?

Kenny:Yes we do. Moving minOccurs and maxOccurs to the sequence element solves the problem for us too. In fact, we have followed Simon's lead to resolve this issue in our implementation. 
 
I propose we record the fix for the Microsoft toolkit as a tweak, and add it to [1], but not modify the xsd for semantic correctness and maximum interoperability.

=== Is a Service required to provide an "expired" `contentList` in the Lending Model ===

Kenny: Section 4.1.1.1 states:
"
...
• offer the issued 
contentList 
"          

Is a Service required to also offer an "expired" `contentList` in this model?

This section then states:
"
...
• if issued,the Content item must be listed in either the User's issued or expired contentList until it is returned
...
"

Do we need to be more specific on when the content appears in the "issued" and "expired" `contentList`(s)?  

=== marking multiple Announcements as Read ===

kenny: Section 4.5.2 states:
"
...
After rendering each announcement to a User, a Reading System should immediately invoke the 
markAnnouncementsAsRead operation to inform the Service not to send the announcement again the next time the User connects to the Service. 
...
"

The read parameter to the markAnnouncementsAsRead operation is capable of holding more than one announcement IDs. Should we modify the verbiage to make it clear that an RS can mark multiple announcements as read through the markAnnouncementsAsRead operation, and that it does not need to invoke this operation after rendering every individual announcement to the user?    
    
     === Spec update review ===

  # documentation including the wsdl and xsd files. (?)
  # Primer. (available with the change log reflected by 10 Feb) 
  # systems testing and test suite documents. (?)
  # Conformance Report (Deferred to end March)

Resources for proof reading?

=== Test suite Progress review ===

==== [http://code.google.com/p/daisy-online-delivery/wiki/tsg_test_suite Test Suite] ====

Call for volunteers:
  * Review.
  * Add test cases.
  * Compare against change log for any inconsistencies.

==== [http://code.google.com/p/daisy-online-delivery/wiki/ProtocolSystemTestingTestCases Systems Testing] ====

Geoff: I'd like to start filling in who does what in the system testing.  Since the protocol is client-driven, it will mostly be client developers running the tests.  I'll try to spread the tests out evenly among the client developers who participate.

I need both client and server developers to send me a list of which tests you are going to be capable of performing (something like, "All except X, Y and Z," is fine, too).  I'll do some kind of mix-and-match and send out the assigned tests for confirmation.

Realistically, we have until near the end of March to do the testing.  However, I'd like to get started as early as possible: when the protocol is finalized and implementors have integrated the changes into their systems.  It would be nice if test reports trickled in as they get done, rather than as a huge lump at the end, so we can watch the progress and reassign tests if needed.
