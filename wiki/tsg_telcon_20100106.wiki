=== Issues ===

==== Issue 128 ====

markus: IBMs WS-I Validator says:

The errors below were detected when validating the file "kxo.xsd" via the
file "do-wsdl-10.wsdl".  In most cases these errors can be detected by
validating "kxo.xsd" directly.  However it is possible that errors will
only occur when kxo.xsd is validated in the context of do-wsdl-10.wsdl.

Line 63: InvalidRegex: Pattern value
'([A-Za-z0-9-_:])+(\.([A-Za-z0-9-_:])+)*' is not a valid regular
expression. The reported error was: ''-' is an invalid character range.
Write '\-'.'.

markus: Matt fixed this in the local version. Need to report to PDTB2 folks.
 
markus on behalf of Matt:  That aside, there's a bad regex in the schema:
{{{ 
<xs:pattern value="([A-Za-z0-9-_:])+(\.([A-Za-z0-9-_:])+)*" />
}}}
As I'm sure you know, dashes delimit character ranges in character sets unless they
are the first character, so the above should be:
{{{
<xs:pattern value="([-A-Za-z0-9_:])+(\.([-A-Za-z0-9_:])+)*" />
}}}
markus: The PDTB folks have been informed. We want to reference kxo.xsd in its canonical
location in the final release, but depend on this to be fixed there first.

==== Issue 144 ====

Markus: xml.xsd, dc.xsd, kxo.xsd are all examples of schemas that have canonical
URIs associated with them. Once development is done, we should revert to
using those URIs instead of local copies.

==== Issue 177 ====

Geoff: In the supportedUplinkAudioCodecs part of the serviceAttributes, the
individual codecs are identified by "The codec's canonical identifier
string as dictated by its specification."

http://www.daisy.org/projects/daisy-online-delivery/drafts/20090910/do-spec-20090910.html#tp_codec

This is problematic, since many specs don't dictate a "canonical identifier
string".  Perhaps MIME type would be better, or else dc:Format.
 
 ==== Issue 189 ====

Geoff: Appendix A states, "Service implementors must publish a concrete WSDL
document at some URI. The [INFOSET] of the concrete WSDL document must be
identical to the do-wsdl-10.wsdl document with the exception of the WSDL
service element, which defines the locally supported ports."

It should either be allowed or required that, rather than creating a
nearly-identical document to serve as a Service's concrete WSDL, that the
concrete WSDL imports do-wsdl-10.wsdl.  For example:

example.wsdl:
{{{
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<definitions xmlns:soap="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/wsdl/soap/"
xmlns:tns="http://www.daisy.org/ns/daisy-online/"
targetNamespace="http://www.daisy.org/ns/daisy-online/"
xmlns="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/wsdl/">

  <import namespace="http://www.daisy.org/ns/daisy-online/"
location="http://www.daisy.org/projects/daisy-online-delivery/do-wsdl-10.wsdl"/>
  
  <service name="example">
    <document>
      Example DAISY Online Service
    </document>

    <port name="examplePort" binding="tns:DaisyOnlineService">
      <soap:address location="http://example.com/daisy-online/"/>
    </port>
  </service>
</definitions>
}}}
==== Issue 192 ====

geoff: We currently have the lastModifiedDate for a Content item displayed only in
the `<contentItem>` element within a contentList.  Suppose you already have
some Content and want to check whether it has been updated.  Do you have to
find a contentList that the contentItem might be in to check it?  This
isn't a big problem for out-of-band selection, since there are only a few
lists to choose from, but what about browse selection?

Geoff: I'm thinking we should add lastModifiedDate to the contentMetadata.  Another place
might be the contentResources, except we've already decided that Services can limit
the number of calls to getContentResources.

Geoff: Also, the documentation for contentList/contentItem@lastModifiedDate says that this
should equal the last modified time of the most recently modified resource of the
Content.  However, there is the edge case where a resource has been removed, so even
though the Content has been updated, the lastModifiedDate is no later than it was
before the resource was deleted, when it should reflect the last change to the Content.

==== Issue 193 ====

Geoff: How does a Reading System notify a Service that it supports all Content
formats and MIME types?  For instance, say it's a proxy downloader that
doesn't actually know what formats are supported on the playback device,
and the Service shouldn't filter by format.
 
==== Issue 197 ====

Kenny on behalf of Jelle: If the getBookmark and setBookmark operations were to be replaced by 
getBlob and setBlob operations, and instead of posting and retrieving a 
bookmarkset type, a Reading System could post any string or perhaps a 
binary blob, would this be a more expedient approach to handling bookmarks 
in the spec?
