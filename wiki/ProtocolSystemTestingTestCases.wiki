#summary The test cases used for the protocol system testing.
#labels Phase-QA

= Introduction =

These are the test cases for system testing of the protocol.  Some of these may overlap with ones in the [tsg_test_suite implementation conformance test suite].

= Requirements =

== Efficient use of bandwidth ==
[RequirementsDocument#Efficient_use_of_bandwidth Requirement]

=== Download content ===

Use a Service to find and download an entire Content item.  Ensure that the Content is downloaded in a reasonable amount of time.

=== Protocol overhead ===

In a typical session, measure the ratio of bytes transferred for messages (i.e., over SOAP) vs. bytes transferred for Content(i.e., over plain HTTP/HTTPS).

=== Audio response ===

Send an audio response to a dynamic menu item that supports it.  Ensure that the audio is uploaded in a reasonable amount of time.

== Key authorization ==
[RequirementsDocument#Key_authorization Requirement]

=== Connect with authorization ===

Initialize a session with a Service using correct user credentials.

=== Deny incorrect authorization ===

Attempt to initialize a session with a Service using a valid user name, but an incorrect password.  The Service must respond "false" to the logOn operation.

=== Allow content download with correct credentials ===

Download a resource with basic authentication credentials provided by the Service.

=== Deny content download with incorrect credentials ===

Attempt to download a resource with incorrect basic authentication credentials.  The file server must respond with an HTTP status of 403.

== Transmit bookmarks ==
[RequirementsDocument#Transmit_bookmarks Requirement]

=== Store and retrieve a user-created bookmark ===

Create a bookmark for a Content item.  Use setBookmarks to transmit the bookmark to a Service.  Use getBookmarks to retrieve the bookmark from the Service.

=== Retrieve a service provider-created bookmark ===

Use getBookmarks to retrieve a list of predefined bookmarks from a Service.

== Return book ==
[RequirementsDocument#Return_book Requirement]

=== Test case name ===

Test case description

== Transmit capabilities ==
[RequirementsDocument#Transmit_capabilities Requirement]

=== Set Reading System attributes ===

Initialize a session with a Service.  Verify that the Reading System's attributes were sent to the Service.

=== Adapt Service to the Reading System's capabilities ===

Initialize a session with a Service that provides different Content based on the capabilities of the Reading System.  Ensure that the Content and resources offered by the Service are only in the formats given in the readingSystemAttributes provided to the Service.

== Universal protocol ==
[RequirementsDocument#Universal_protocol Requirement]

=== Full session ===

Perform a full session, from logOn to logOff.  (This test must be performed with as many combinations of clients and servers as possible.)

== Player stores contact information ==
[RequirementsDocument#Player_stores_contact_information Requirement]

=== Connect to a new Service ===

Add a new Service location and credentials to a Reading System, then connect to the Service with it.  (This is to demonstrate that Service Discovery is not a necessary part of the protocol.)

== Content at different location ==
[RequirementsDocument#Content_at_different_location Requirement]

=== Test case name ===

Test case description

== Time interrogation ==
[RequirementsDocument#Time_interrogation Requirement]

This was not implemented, so there are no test cases for this requirement.

== Download and streaming ==
[RequirementsDocument#Download_and_streaming Requirement]

=== Test case name ===

== Key delivery ==
[RequirementsDocument#Key_delivery Requirement]

=== Test case name ===

Test case description

== Same book, different player ==
[RequirementsDocument#Same_book,_different_player Requirement]

=== Test case name ===

Test case description

== Bookmark stored on server ==
[RequirementsDocument#Bookmark_stored_on_server Requirement]

=== Test case name ===

Test case description

== Issue content ==
[RequirementsDocument#Issue_content Requirement]

=== Test case name ===

Test case description

== Audio and text annotation ==
[RequirementsDocument#Audio_and_text_annotation Requirement]

=== Test case name ===

Test case description

== Stop and resume download ==
[RequirementsDocument#Stop_and_resume_download Requirement]

=== Test case name ===

Test case description

== Dynamic menus ==
[RequirementsDocument#Dynamic_menus Requirement]

=== Test case name ===

Test case description

== Noninteractive session ==
[RequirementsDocument#Noninteractive_session Requirement]

=== Test case name ===

Test case description

== Prioritize order of files ==
[RequirementsDocument#Prioritize_order_of_files Requirement]

=== Test case name ===

Test case description

== Interact with content ==
[RequirementsDocument#Interact_with_content Requirement]

=== Test case name ===

Test case description

== Report firmware version ==
[RequirementsDocument#Report_firmware_version Requirement]

=== Test case name ===

Test case description

== Report download activity ==
[RequirementsDocument#Report_download_activity Requirement]

This was not implemented, so there are no test cases for this requirement.

== Report player errors ==
[RequirementsDocument#Report_player_errors Requirement]

This was not implemented, so there are no test cases for this requirement.

== Report which server is in control ==
[RequirementsDocument#Report_which_server_is_in_control Requirement]

This was not implemented, so there are no test cases for this requirement.

== Protect user privacy ==
[RequirementsDocument#Protect_user_privacy Requirement]

=== Test case name ===

Test case description

== Localized, plain language error messages ==
[RequirementsDocument#Localized,_plain_language_error_messages Requirement]

=== Test case name ===

Test case description

= Expectations =

== Audio feedback ==
[RequirementsDocument#Requires_some_player_functionality Requirement] (never formally moved back in scope)

=== Test case name ===
