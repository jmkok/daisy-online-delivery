#summary Lists of conformance test cases for both Reading Systems and Services.
#labels Phase-QA

= Introduction =

The test suite consists of two lists of test cases to verify that a Reading System or Service conforms to the DAISY Online specification.  These test cases are not comprehensive, but represent both normal cases and edge cases.

The test cases in each list are grouped by category, and what assertion they test.

= Reading System conformance =

== 1. General ==

  # All programming constructs generated conform to the published WSDL.      
  # All required operations are implemented as specified in the normative WSDL.
  # The Reading System complies with WS-i Basic Profile 1.1.

== 2. Authentication and session management ==

  # The session initialization sequence is followed to commence a session with a Service.
    # Verify that the first operation called in a session is logOn.
    # After a successful log on, verify the the second operation called in a session is getServiceAttributes.
    # After a successful getServiceAttributes, verify that the third operation called in a session is setReadingSystemAttributes.

== 7. Publishing updates and instalments ==

== 8. Rights management ==

== 9. Service announcements ==

== 10. Dynamic menus ==

= Service conformance =

== 1. General ==

  # The WSDL published by the Service is canonically equivalent to the normative WSDL provided in the specification.
  # All programming constructs generated conform to the published WSDL.      
  # The Service is available over HTTP or HTTPS.
  # All fault stipulations in the normative WSDL are adhered to by the Service.
  # All required operations are implemented as specified in the normative WSDL.
  # The Service complies with WS-i Basic Profile 1.1

== 2. Authentication and session management ==

  # The session initialization sequence is followed to commence a session.   

== 3. Service models ==

== 4. Content selection models ==

== 5. Content retrieval sequence ==

== 6. Content transfer ==

  # Range headers are always honoured in HTTP requests.

== 7. Publishing updates and instalments ==

== 8. Rights management ==

== 9. Service announcements ==

== 10. Dynamic menus ==
