#summary Conformance test cases for both Reading Systems and Services.
#labels Phase-QA

= Introduction =

The test suite consists of two lists of test cases to verify that a Reading System or Service conforms to the DAISY Online specification.  These test cases are not comprehensive, but represent both normal cases and edge cases.

The test cases in each list are grouped by category, and what assertion they test.

At a minimum, a conformant Reading System or Service must pass all tests in category 1, "Core functionality".

= Reading System conformance =

== 1. Core functionality ==

  # All programming constructs generated conform to the published WSDL.      
  # All required operations are implemented as specified in the normative WSDL.
  # The Reading System complies with WS-I Basic Profile 1.1.
  # The session initialization sequence is followed to commence a session with a Service.
    # Verify that the first operation called in a session is `logOn`.
    # After a successful log on, verify the the second operation called in a session is `getServiceAttributes`.
    # After a successful `getServiceAttributes`, verify that the third operation called in a session is `setReadingSystemAttributes`.
  # The Reading System supports one of the service models.
    # The Reading System passes all tests in either category 2 or category 3.
  # The Reading System supports one of the content selection models.
    # The Reading System passes all tests in either category 4 or category 5.

== 2. Lending service model ==

  # Implement the `returnContent` operation.
  # Support the "issued" and "expired" `contentList`s.
  # Support the `requiresReturn` attribute of the `contentMetadata` type.   
  # Support the `returnBy` attribute of the `contentMetadata` type.
  # must not call `returnContent` for a particular piece of content until all local copies of the content have been removed off its storage.
  # Should retrieve the "expired" `contentList` at least once in a session if any borrowed Content exists.      
  # Should return any borrowed Content listed in the expired list after notifying the user.

== 3. Acquisition service model ==

  # Support the `requiresReturn` attribute of the `contentMetadata` type.
  # *GGT: This is not necessary to support the acquisition model.* Support the "issued" contentList.
  # If `returnContent` is implemented, it must not be called for any content that has `@requiresReturn=false` in its `contentMetadata`. 

== 4. Out-of-band selection model ==

== 5. Browse selection model ==

== 6. Updates and instalments ==

== 7. Rights management ==

== 8. Set bookmarks ==

== 9. Get bookmarks ==

== 10. Dynamic menus ==

== 11. Service announcements ==

== 12. Key provision ==

= Service conformance =

== 1. Core functionality ==

  # The WSDL published by the Service is canonically equivalent to the normative WSDL provided in the specification.
  # All programming constructs generated conform to the published WSDL.      
  # The Service is available over HTTP or HTTPS.
  # All fault stipulations in the normative WSDL are adhered to by the Service.
  # All required operations are implemented as specified in the normative WSDL.
  # The Service complies with WS-I Basic Profile 1.1
  # The session initialization sequence is followed to commence a session.   
  # Range headers are always honored in HTTP requests.
