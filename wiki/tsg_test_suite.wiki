#summary Conformance test cases for both Reading Systems and Services.
#labels Phase-QA

= Introduction =

The test suite consists of two lists of test cases to verify that a Reading System or Service conforms to the DAISY Online specification.  These test cases are not comprehensive, but represent both normal cases and edge cases.

The test cases in each list are grouped by category, and what assertion they test.

At a minimum, a conformant Reading System or Service must pass all tests in category 1, "Core functionality".

= Reading System conformance =

== 1. Core functionality ==

  # All programming constructs generated conform to the published WSDL.      
  # All required operations are implemented as specified in the normative WSDL.
  # The Reading System complies with WS-I Basic Profile 1.1.
  # The session initialization sequence is followed to commence a session with a Service.
   # Verify that the first operation called in a session is `logOn`.
   # After a successful log on, verify the the second operation called in a session is `getServiceAttributes`.
   # After a successful `getServiceAttributes`, verify that the third operation called in a session is `setReadingSystemAttributes`.
  # The Reading System supports one of the service models.
   # The Reading System passes all tests in either category 2 or category 3.
  # The Reading System supports one of the content selection models.
   # The Reading System passes all tests in either category 4 or category 5.

== 2. Lending service model ==

  # Implement the `returnContent` operation.
  # Support the "issued" and "expired" `contentList`s.
  # Support the `requiresReturn` attribute of the `contentMetadata` type.   
  # Support the `returnBy` attribute of the `contentMetadata` type.
  # must not call `returnContent` for a particular piece of content until all local copies of the content have been removed off its storage.
  # Should retrieve the "expired" `contentList` at least once in a session if any borrowed Content exists.      
  # Should return any borrowed Content listed in the expired list after notifying the user.

== 3. Acquisition service model ==

  # Support the `requiresReturn` attribute of the `contentMetadata` type.
  # *GGT: This is not necessary to support the acquisition model.* Support the "issued" contentList.
  # If `returnContent` is implemented, it must not be called for any content that has `@requiresReturn=false` in its `contentMetadata`. 

== 4. Out-of-band selection model ==

  # Support the invoking of the getContentList operation with the "new" id parameter.
  # Support the invoking of the getContentList operation with the "issued" id parameter.(kj: this is listed as a may in the spec. Need to decide if this assertion should be met for compliance.)   
  # Support the invoking of the following operations in the sequence listed below for each content item in the retrieved Content List:
   # getContentMetadata     
   # issueContent
   # getContentResources
 
== 5. Browse selection model ==

  # Support the Dynamic Menus protocol feature.
  # Support the getContentList operation.
  # Support the invoking of the following operations in the sequence listed below for each content item in the retrieved Content List:
   # getContentMetadata     
   # issueContent
   # getContentResources
 
== 6. Updates and instalments ==

  # Support the lastModifiedDate attribute on contentList.contentItem.
  # Support the lastModifiedDate attribute on resources.resource. (kj: need to determine whether this is a must for conformance.)  
  # Invoke the getContentResources operation when determined that content has been updated on the Service through the lastModifiedDate attribute of contentList.contentItem.

== 7. Rights management and Key provision ==

  # Declare support for pdtb2 by setting the value of the supportedContentProtectionFormats element to PDTB2 when invoking the setReadingSystemAttributes operation.
  # Support the operation element set to a value of PDTB2_KEY_PROVISION in the serviceAttributes type retrieved through a call to the getServiceAttributes operation to determine if the Service supports PDTB2.   
  # Support the getKeyExchangeObject operation.
  # Support the meta attribute pdtb2:specVersion with the value set to 2005-1 in contentMetadata to determine if the content being downloaded is PDTB2 protected.  
  # Support the PDTB2 spec.

== 8. Set bookmarks ==

  # Support the portable bookmarks and highlights grammar described by the bookmark-2005-1.xsd file. 
  # Support the operation element set to a value of set_bookmarks in the serviceAttributes type retrieved through a call to the getServiceAttributes operation to determine whether the Service supports the setBookMarks operation.
  # Support the setBookmarks operation.
  # IF a Service supports both the getBookmarks and setBookmarks operations, the lastMark attribute of the bookmarkSet type should be used to store the user's last reading position. (kj: need to decide whether this is a must)
  # IF a Service supports both the getBookmarks and setBookmarks operations, the last reading position should be checked before playback is resumed. (kj: need to decide whether this is a must)
  # must not submit audio recordings as a part of the setBookmarks operation.
           
== 9. Get bookmarks ==

  # Support the portable bookmarks and highlights grammar described by the bookmark-2005-1.xsd file. 
  # Support the operation element set to a value of get_bookmarks in the serviceAttributes type retrieved through a call to the getServiceAttributes operation to determine whether the Service supports the getBookMarks operation.
  # Support the getBookmarks operation.
  # IF a Service supports both the getBookmarks and setBookmarks operations, the lastMark attribute of the bookmarkSet type should be used to store the user's last reading position. (kj: need to decide whether this is a must)
  # IF a Service supports both the getBookmarks and setBookmarks operations, the last reading position should be checked before playback is resumed. (kj: need to decide whether this is a must)
           
== 10. Dynamic menus ==

  # Support the operation element set to a value of dynamic_menus in the serviceAttributes type retrieved through a call to the getServiceAttributes operation to determine whether the Service supports dynamic menus.
  # Support the getQuestions operation.
  # The userResponses type parameter passed when invoking the getQuestions operation must contain either a response to a previous question or one of the following special IDs:
   # default
   # search
   # back
  # If a Service sends more than one question in a questions type, the user's response to each of the questions should be collected, and posted in the next call to the getQuestions operation through a separate userResponse property.
  # Declare what input types it supports in the readingSystemAttributes type posted to the Service through a call to the setReadingSystemAttributes operation.   
  # Invoke the getContentList operation when a call to the getQuestions operation yields a questions type that contains a contentListRef child element.    
 
== 11. Service announcements ==

  # Support the getServiceAnnouncements operation.
  # Support the operation element set to a value of service_announcements in the serviceAttributes type retrieved through a call to the getServiceAttributes operation to determine whether the Service supports Service Announcements. 
  # Treat the IDs of individual announcements as valid only for the duration of a session.
  # After an announcement has been rendered, immediately invoke the markAnnouncementsAsRead operation to inform the Service not to send the announcement again on the next invokation of the getServiceAnnouncements operation.
  # Only invoke the markAnnouncementsAsRead operation with the IDs of announcements retrieved from the last invokation of the getServiceAnnouncements operation in the active session.
  # Support the rendering of audio and text announcements for maximum interoperability. (kj: need to decide if this should be a must)         
  # Check for new announcements by invoking the getServiceAnnouncements operation at least once per session.
  
= Service conformance =

== 1. Core functionality ==

  # The WSDL published by the Service is canonically equivalent to the normative WSDL provided in the specification.
  # All programming constructs generated conform to the published WSDL.      
  # The Service is available over HTTP or HTTPS.
  # All fault stipulations in the normative WSDL are adhered to by the Service.
  # All required operations are implemented as specified in the normative WSDL.
  # The Service complies with WS-I Basic Profile 1.1
  # The session initialization sequence is followed to commence a session.   
    # Before initialization, calling any operation except `logOn` should return `NoActiveSession` fault.
    # During initialization, after a successful `logOn`, calling any operation except `logOn` or `getServiceAttributes` should return an `InvalidOperation` fault.
    # During initialization, after a successful `getServiceAttributes`, calling any operation except `logOn` or `setReadingSystemAttributes` should return an `InvalidOperation` fault.
    # After a session has been initialized, calling `getServiceAttributes` or `setReadingSystemAttribtues` again should not return a fault.
    # After a session has been established, calling `logOn` again (with the correct credentials) should return `true`.
    # If a successful `logOn` is performed in the middle of a session, calling any other operation except `logOn` or `getServiceAttributes` should return an `InvalidOperation` fault.
    # After a session has been initialized, calling `logOff` should return `true`.
    # If a `logOff` was successful, calling any other operation except `logOn` should return `NoActiveSessionFault`.
  # Range headers are always honored in HTTP requests.

== 2. Lending service model ==

== 3. Acquisition service model ==

== 4. Out-of-band selection model ==

  # provide one or more out-of-band mechanisms for the selection/assignment of Content.
  # declare support for the Out-of-band content selection method in the supportedContentSelectionMethods element of its serviceAttributes.     
  # expose the selected Content to the Reading System through the getContentList operation when the operation is invoked with the id parameter set to the value new. 
 
== 5. Browse selection model ==

  # provide support for the Dynamic Menus protocol feature.
