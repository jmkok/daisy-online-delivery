#summary Conformance test cases for both Reading Systems and Services.
#labels Phase-QA

_GGT: I've marked up the Reading System conformance section with some observations. I have two main concerns with it: the "optional" assertions and assertions that aren't about Reading Systems but about Services._

_GGT: Regarding the assertions that are really for Services, an example would be section 8, assertion 1.  Supporting the value of a `serviceAttributes/supportedOptionalOperations/operation` element to be "PDTB2_KEY_PROVISION" is already covered in the core functionality (under conforming to the schema). It's not well-defined what "supporting" that value means, other than accepting it as a valid value. The requirement is for the Service to provide that value to the Reading System, not for the Reading System to do anything with it._

kj: I have removed all the optional assertions. As for the Service conformance assertions in the Reading System conformance item, i think the Reading Systems must understand the elements/attributes set forth by these assertions, so I recorded them in the RS conformance area.            

= Introduction =

The test suite consists of two lists of test cases to verify that a Reading System or Service conforms to the DAISY Online specification.  These test cases are not comprehensive, but represent both normal cases and edge cases.

The test cases in each list are grouped by category, and what assertion they test.

A Reading System or Service must satisfy all test cases for all assertions in a category to claim conformance to the particular category.  

At a minimum, a conformant Reading System or Service must satisfy all Assertions in category 1, "Core functionality".

= Reading System conformance =

== 1. Core functionality ==

  # All programming constructs (i.e. operations, types, faults, namespaces, classes, interfaces) generated conform to the normative WSDL.
  # Comply with WS-I Basic Profile 1.1.
  # Support HTTP and HTTPS.
  # Support HTTP Basic Authentication. 
  # Support HTTP range headers 
  # Support HTTP cookies.  
  # Implement the `logOn` operation.
  # Implement the  `logOff` operation.
  # Implement the `setReadingSystemAttributes` operation.
  # Implement the  `getServiceAttributes` operation.
  # Implement the  `issueContent` operation.
  # Implement the `getContentList` operation.
   # Support the invokation of the `getContentList` operation with the "new" id.  
  # Implement the `getContentMetadata` operation.
  # Implement the `getContentResources` operation. 
  # Adhere to the session initialization sequence to commence a session with a Service.
  # Adhere to the Content Retrieval sequence to download/stream content from a Service.
  # Support one or both of the service models.
    # Satisfy all assertions in category 2 and/or category 3.
  # Support one or both of the content selection models:
    # Satisfy all assertions in category 4 and/or category 5.
  # Support the `contentMetadata@requiresReturn` attribute to determine whether the content needs to be returned.   

== 2. Lending service model ==

  # Implement the `returnContent` operation.
  # Support the "issued" and "expired" `contentList`s. _GGT: "expired" is not required._
  # Support the `resources@returnBy` attribute.
  # Must not call `returnContent` for a particular Content item until all local copies of the Content have been removed off its storage.

== 3. Acquisition service model ==

 # Must not call the `requiresReturn` operation for any content that has `contentMetadata@requiresReturn` set to `false`.

== 4. Out-of-band selection model ==

_GGT: Neither of these assertions capture what it means to support out-of-band selection. Unfortunately I don't have any suggestions at present._
kj: need to find appropriate verbiage.

== 5. Browse selection model ==

  # Satisfy the assertions in category 11. 
 
== 6. Updates and installments ==

  # Support `contentList/contentItem@lastModifiedDate`. 
  # Support `resources/resource@lastModifiedDate`. 

_GGT: Should add:_ (kj: what would we say for streaming then? Would an RS need to stream if content is updated?)
  * Download resources when they have been updated. _The wording needs to be worked out._

== 7. Rights management ==  

  # Support PDTB2.
  # Set a `readingSystemAttributes/config/supportedContentProtectionFormats/protectionFormat` element to "PDTB2" in all calls to the `setReadingSystemAttributes` operation.
  # Support the meta attribute pdtb2:specVersion with the value set to 2005-1 in contentMetadata to determine if the content being downloaded is PDTB2 protected.  _GGT: This is a service requirement, not a reading system requirement._ kj: is this not a must understand for RS? 
== 8. Key Exchange ==

  # Support the operation element set to a value of PDTB2_KEY_PROVISION in the serviceAttributes type retrieved through a call to the getServiceAttributes operation to determine if the Service supports key provision.  _GGT: This is a service requirement, not a reading system requirement._ kj: Is this not a must understand?   # Set value(s) for `readingSystemAttributes/config/keyRing/item` element(s) in all calls to the `setReadingSystemAttributes` operation.
  # Support the `getKeyExchangeObject` operation.
  # Satisfy all assertions in category 7.
 
== 9. Set bookmarks ==

  # Support the portable bookmarks and highlights grammar described by the bookmark-2005-1.xsd file and section 9 of the ANSI/NISO Z39.86 specification.
  # Support the operation element set to a value of SET_BOOKMARKS in the serviceAttributes type retrieved through a call to the getServiceAttributes operation to determine whether the Service supports the setBookMarks operation. _GGT: This is a service requirement, not a reading system requirement._kj: Is this not a must understand?
  # Support the `setBookmarks` operation.
  # must not submit audio recordings as a part of the setBookmarks operation. _GGT: This is not a requirement, it is a limitation of the spec._kj: Reading Systems still need to make sure that they don't allow audio recordings. I think it should be a testable assertion.      
           
== 10. Get bookmarks ==

  # Support the portable bookmarks and highlights grammar described by the bookmark-2005-1.xsd file and section 9 of the ANSI/NISO Z39.86 specification.
  # Support the operation element set to a value of GET_BOOKMARKS in the serviceAttributes type retrieved through a call to the getServiceAttributes operation to determine whether the Service supports the getBookMarks operation. _GGT: This is a service requirement, not a reading system requirement._ kj: is this not a must understand?
  # Support the `getBookmarks` operation.
           
== 11. Dynamic menus ==

  # Support the operation element set to a value of DYNAMIC_MENUS in the serviceAttributes type retrieved through a call to the getServiceAttributes operation to determine whether the Service supports dynamic menus. _GGT: This is a service requirement, not a reading system requirement._ kj: Is this not a must understand?
  # Support the `getQuestions` operation.
  # The `userResponses` parameter passed to the `getQuestions` operation must contain either a response to a previous question(s) or one of the reserved IDs: "default", "search" or "back". 

== 12. Service announcements ==

  # Support the `getServiceAnnouncements` operation.
  # Support the operation element set to a value of SERVICE_ANNOUNCEMENTS in the serviceAttributes type retrieved through a call to the getServiceAttributes operation to determine whether the Service supports Service Announcements.  _GGT: This is a service requirement, not a reading system requirement._kj: is this not a must understand?
  # After an announcement has been rendered, immediately invoke the markAnnouncementsAsRead operation to inform the Service not to send the announcement again on the next invocation of the getServiceAnnouncements operation. (kj: question about multiple announcement ids being posted through the read type.)
