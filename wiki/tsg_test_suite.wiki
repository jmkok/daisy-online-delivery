#summary Conformance test cases for both Reading Systems and Services.
#labels Phase-QA

= Introduction =

The test suite consists of two lists of test cases to verify that a Reading System or Service conforms to the DAISY Online specification.  These test cases are not comprehensive, but represent both normal cases and edge cases.

The test cases in each list are grouped by category, and what assertion they test.

There are two types of assertions: Required and optional. A Reading System or Service must satisfy all test cases for all required assertions in a category to claim conformance to the particular category.  

At a minimum, a conformant Reading System or Service must satisfy all Required Assertions in category 1, "Core functionality".

= Reading System conformance =

== 1. Core functionality ==

=== Required Assertions ===

  # Support the Wrapped Document-Literal WSDL Binding Style. _GGT: This is redundant. The following assertion already covers this._
  # All programming constructs (i.e. operations, types, faults, namespaces, classes, interfaces) generated conform to the normative WSDL.
  # Comply with WS-I Basic Profile 1.1.
  # Support HTTP and HTTPS.
  # Support HTTP Basic Authentication. 
  # Support HTTP range headers 
  # Support HTTP cookies.  
  # Implement all the following required operations: _GGT: These need to be separate assertions.  The formatting makes it look like they are test cases._
   # `logOn`
   # `logOff`
   # `setReadingSystemAttributes`
   # `getServiceAttributes`
   # `issueContent`
   # `getContentList`
   # `getContentMetadata`
   # `getContentResources`
  # Adhere to the following session initialization sequence to commence a session with a Service: _GGT: The formatting here makes it look like these are test cases._
   # Invoke the logOn operation as the first operation call in a session.   
   # After a successful log on, invoke the getServiceAttributes operation. 
   # If the invokation of the `getServiceAttributes` operation is successful, invoke the setReadingSystemAttributes operation. 
  # Support one or both of the service models.
    # Satisfy all required assertions in category 2 and/or category 3.
  # Support one or both of the content selection models:
    # Satisfy all required assertions in category 4 and/or category 5.

=== Optional Assertions ===

_GGT: Optional assertions have no place in conformance testing.  An optional assertion tells you nothing about conformance.  If an assertion isn't required in a category, it should be left out._

None

  # Implement the `returnContent` operation.
  # Support the "issued" and "expired" `contentList`s. _GGT: "expired" is not required._

  # Support the `returnBy` attribute of the `resources` type.
  # Must not call `returnContent` for a particular piece of content until all local copies of the content have been removed off its storage.

=== optional Assertions ===

  # Should return any borrowed Content in the expired list after notifying the user.
