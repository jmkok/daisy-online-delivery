  * Kenny add a normative assertion, that sets forth the invalidParameter fault as the consequence of a Reading System calling the getQuestions operation with the "back" and "search" IDs, when these IDs are not supported by a Service.

=== Issues ===

==== Issue 206 ====

Geoff: Section 2: The Main Menu contains a lot of general information after the
example of showing the main menu.  This kind of breaks the flow of the
examples, and should be reordered.

==== Issue 207 ====

Geoff: The search example in the Primer is a little rudimentary, even for an
example.  I think it might be better to show the User searching on multiple
fields at once, like:
 
Advanced Search
Title: _____
Author: _____
Subject: _____
Narrator: _____
Call number: _____
Full text: _____
 
And the user searches on, say, Author="asimov" and Subject="myster*", with
the results being some of Isaac Asimov's "Black Widowers" books.

==== Issue 208 ====

Geoff: In Section 4.4.1 Content Retrieval Sequence, the first note is:
 
"Note:
 
"A Reading System must retrieve a contentList from a Service using one of
the methods described in Content Selection Methods prior to requesting that
the Service issue any items."
 
I don't think this is a requirement, merely normal operation.  The word
"must" should be changed.
 
==== Issue 209 ====

Geoff: The second note in point 2 of section 4.4.1 says:
 
"Note:
 
"This protocol does not specify the Reading System behaviors that occur
when a Service does not return a true value."
 
This is untrue, as we have just specified some behaviour in the preceding
paragraph.  Should be removed.

==== Issue 210 ====

Geoff: The note in 4.4.3 should be expanded upon and made not a note.

==== Issue 211 ====

Geoff: Content gets used in various ways in the text.  We should settle on whether
Content is singular, plural or a collective noun and stick to it throughout
the documentation.  (I think collective noun is best, with Content item as
singular and Content items as plural.)

==== Issue 212 ====

Geoff: Sometimes we say "call an operation" sometimes, it's "invoke an operation".
 We should decide on one and stick to it.  I say, "call".

Also, "invoke the X operation" is kind of wordy.  Apart from introducing
operations, that should be shortened to "call X" or "invoke X", whichever
we decide.

==== Issue 213 ====

Geoff: There are too many notes in the spec.  This breaks up the flow and makes
important highlights harder to notice.  We should only use notes for
unexpected things (like audio notes not being supported in bookmarks) and
not for everything after the first paragraph in a section.

==== Issue 214 ====

Geoff: Section 5.2.3. The returnContent Operation, just before the note:

A Reading System must not call returnContent on Content it has never been
issued.

This is a bit awkwardly put.  Something like, "on Content that has never
been issued to it," would be better.
 
=== PDTB2 support progress review ===

  * Sample KXOs.
  * RS and Service Implementers?   
  * Implementation Timelines.
  
=== Test suite Progress review ===

==== [http://code.google.com/p/daisy-online-delivery/wiki/tsg_test_suite Conformance Testing] ====

  * What remains to be done? (define and assign outstanding tasks)
   
==== [http://code.google.com/p/daisy-online-delivery/wiki/ProtocolSystemTestingTestCases Systems Testing] ====

==== [http://code.google.com/p/daisy-online-delivery/wiki/SummaryOfRecommendations Summary of Recommendations] ====

  * Should this document be a part of the test suite? This will mean that the test suite is composed of three documents: Conformance Testing, Systems Testing and Summary of Recommendations. 

kenny: At first glance, due to the informative nature of this document, it does not appear to belong to the Test Suite. Thoughts all?
