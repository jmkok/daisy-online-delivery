== Agenda/Minutes ==

=== What should a Service return where getQuestions"Back") is invoked when no previous call to the getQuestions operation has been made in the active session ===
 
==== Discussion on the List ====

Kenny: If a Reading System sends a "back" id in a userResponses type passed into the getQuestions operation, when there has been no previous call to the getQuestions operation in the active session, what must a Service return? 
 
The following two options come to mind:
1. Throw an invalidParameter fault.
 
2. Return the main menu i.e. equivalent to getQuestions("default")
 
Since this is a question that all implementers that support the dynamic menu feature with the back accessory will need to think about, what are your thoughts on adding a recommendation to the primer when we do a pass on it suggesting one of these two approaches, or perhaps a better approach?     

Geoff: InvalidParameter.

kenny: Any dissenters? Anyone leaning towards the getQuestions("default") option? My vote is for invalidParameter too to make it consistent with other parts of the spec.          

Johan: I vote for getQuestions("default")

In a scenario where the user have been exploring the menu and taken a certain path, the user decides to start all over again. Unfortunately, the device does not support this functionality so the user must press the back button repeatedly until the main menu is presented again. Once the main menu is rendered to the user, what should happen if the user press the back button again? invalidParameter or getQuestions("default"). This scenario is identical to browsing the internet in your web browser. Lets assume that you start from www.google.com and end up at www.daisy.org. If you start pressing the back button you will eventually reach your start page. Once back at the start, you will not be able to press the back button anymore, but if you were one could ask himself what would happen. I would not like to see error message.

However, the spec should be consistent so if the majority vote for invalidParameter then I'm happy to implement it.
  
kenny: Thanks Johan.
 
We have two votes for invalidParameter and one vote for getQuestions("default") thus far.
 
Nick, Jelle, Simon, hiro, and all, which of the two options would you like to vote for?    
 
I intend to update the Primer before the next call, so please post your votes to the list over the next couple of days.     

Nick: My vote is for invalidParameter.
 
The reading system knows that the service does not support serverside back from the supportsServerSideBack in the serviceAttrributes. If a reading system wants to translate the fault into getQuestions("default") it is free to do so.

=== What should happen when a Reading System does not support any input types that an inputQuestion lists in its inputTypes element? ===

==== Discussion on the list ====

Simon: How will dynamic menus work if no supportedInputTypes are present? Will there be a menu with only multiple choices question? 

For example, a player with 4 arrows would not fit in any categories but could still work with multiple choices question.

If this is the case, it might be a code idea to specify it in the spec.

geoff:      The supported input types are strictly for the inputQuestion.  It's assumed that multipleChoiceQuestions would be supported by any reading system that calls getQuestions.  (And a reading system that doesn't support input of any type would have to be an out-of-band system and not need menus.)
 
kenny: I think we should make such assumptions explicit in the spec. I am concerned We may have the contextual understanding that people who have not been involved in the spec development may not have. What does everyone else think? 

kenny: My vote is for adding a normative assertion to the spec stating (to the effect of): A Service must not send an input question to a Reading System when A Reading System has not declared support for any input types in its readingSystemAttributes that are listed in the inputTypes element of the inputQuestion.   
 
This would also cover the case where a Reading System posts an empty supportedInputTypes element in its readingSystemAttributes.

Geoff:  We already have a recommendation to that effect.
 
Dominik: Do we have a category for devices limited to 4 arrows with no numerical keypad?

geoff: We don't.  I was under the impression that such a device would only be able to handle multipleChoiceQuestions, so you'd indicate such by not putting anything at all under supportedInputTypes.  Section 4.7.1. Support says, "A Service should not send any question which requires an input type not supported by the Reading System."

Kenny: Thanks Geoff. I did not spot that recommendation initially. The recommendation is at:
http://www.daisy.org/projects/daisy-online-delivery/drafts/20090927/do-spec-20090927.html#fundamentals_dynamic_menus_qtypes  

I think this recommendation is enough to clarify the ambiguity. 

Thoughts all?
