#summary Minutes Toronto F2F 2009

<wiki:toc />

= Monday July 20 =

== Terms ==

*Agreed*: Namespace uri not to contain doml – eg ns/daisyonline#

*Agreed*: interface, function, parameter and fault mapped to wsdl equivalents in the terminology section.

*Agreed*: use Content except for reference to the Daisy spec PublicationID.

*Agreed*: Download / Stream - streaming implies not storing the content on disc.

*Action: Markus* – spec requires support of range headers on http / https requests. A compliant service provider must support range header. Third parties should support range headers. Reading systems must support responses that do not support range headers.

Third party content provider: needs definition.

*Ongoing*: rename issueContent and returnContent functions.

*Ongoing*: define Dynamic menu generations

Basic vs Advanced (Core vs Optional)

*Proposed*:

 # wdsl with one port type (interface) where all operations that are optional allow the OperationNotSupported fault.
 # In the spec we have required operations and we possible have groups of optional operations.
 # We introduce a new operation by which the reading system can discover which optional operations the service implements – this allows non-implemented operations to be removed from the reading systems ui.

== PDTB2 ==

*Agreed*: we introduct a new operation

getKeyExchangeObject(String supportedPublicKeyNames, String RequestedKeyName )

which returns a Key Exchange Object xml fragment.

This operation is optional.

*Action*: to decide if the contentMetaData fragment needs to define the use or not of PDTB2.

*Action*: to define an xml type for an array of string (sequence).

== Dynamic menus ==

*Proposed*:

Replace the following functions:

 # `getUserChoices`
 # `getUserInput`
 # `getGroupedQuestions`
 # `getUserAnnouncement`
 # `postUserResponses`

with

 # `getMultipleChoiceQuestion(id)`
 # `getQuestion(id)`
 # `getGroupedQuestions(gid)`
 # `getMessage(mid)`
 # `setUserResponses(UserResponses)`

All the "`get`" functions would take an ID only.  All user responses would be sent with the `setUserResponses` function, which would return the `nextOperation`, i.e. the next operation to call in sequence.

Alternatively, the function definitions would remain the same; only the names would change.

These functions could be unified into a single `postUserResponses` function if it is possible to have a complex return type that encapsulates multiple choice, text entry, grouped questions, and user announcements.

== Issue 34 ==

Might be relevant for DAISY 2.02.

*Action - Markus*: Look up the portable bookmark spec.

== Issue 38 ==

*Agreed*: menu and content list IDs should not be expected to be held for longer than one session.  IDs may be held for less a period of time, depending on the server.

Will Reading Systems be caching dynamic menus and content lists?

The content list was intended to be an endpoint; the Reading System would have to start from the "home" menu once it reaches a content list.

*Parked*

== Define a session ==

*Agreed*: The web service session should be separate from the content transfer session.

*Agreed*: The start of a session is a successful `logOn`.  The end of a session is either a `logOut` or a timeout.  WS sessions can span multiple HTTP sessions.

== Issue 40 ==

*Agreed*: Drop the VB examples; keep the Java/C# examples in an appendix.

== Issue 42 ==

*Agreed*: Mark invalid

== Issue 44 ==

*Agreed*: Drop sequence numbers from `userChoices`, `groupedQuestions`, `announcements` and `contentList`.

*Agreed*: `markAnnouncementsAsRead` should take a list of announcement IDs, not a range.

*Action - Markus*: Should IDs be simple Strings or XML Names?

*Agreed*: `contentList` should grow `rangeBegin`, `rangeEnd` and `totalItems` attributes, to allow for downloading parts of the content list.

== Tomorrow ==

*Action - Markus*:
 * Keep WSDL and XSD up to date all the time.
 * Prioritize issues so ones with heavier impact are dealt with earlier.

= Tuesday July 21=

== Group Session 1 ==
=== Issue 61 ====
Proposed Resolution:
 * keep manufacturer and model required
 * make serialNumber optional
 * rename firmwareVersion to version and remains required
 * make supportedProtocols optional, and make clear that only additional protocols than the ones mandate by the spec
 * change name of supportedProtocols to additionalTransferProtocols
 *preferredLanguage rename to preferredUILanguage, keep required

=== Issue 62 ====
Proposed Resolution: supported protocol version information is redundant; handled at the WSDL level.

=== Issue 63 ====
Proposed resolution: no enumeration. Add prose that makes clear this follows the dc:format convention. 

Add informative URIs to daisy2.02 spec and zed specs and epub spec where those particular strings are defined.

=== Issue 64 ====
Proposed Resolution: rename to supportedMimeTypes, clarify that this related to MIME types of both service messages/announcements AND content.

=== Issue 65 ====
Proposed Resolution: rename to supportedInputTypes, change enum to TEXT_NUMERIC, TEXT_ALPHANUMERIC (for now). Revisit audio posting on thursday if we have time.
(Note: discussion about dropping notion of braille entirely in protocol)

=== Issue 66 ====
Already resolved. availableMemory is removed.

=== Issue 67 ====
Already resolved. In mondays notes.

=== Issue 68 ====
Resolved in XSD.

=== Issue 69 ====
Proposed Resolution: make bandwith optional, see clarifying doc in xsd. 

=== Issue 70 ====
