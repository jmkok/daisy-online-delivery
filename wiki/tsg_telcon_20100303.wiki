  * Simon and Geoff reformat the Conformance Testing document, and rename it to Interoperability Testing.
  * Johan provide sample content in contentMetadata. 
  * Kenny add a normative assertion, that sets forth the invalidParameter fault as the consequence of a Reading System calling the getQuestions operation with the "back" id when no prior call to the getQuestions operation has been made in the active session, to the spec and the Interoperability testing documents.
  * Kenny add a normative assertion, that sets forth the invalidParameter fault as the consequence of a Reading System calling the getQuestions operation with the "back" and "search" IDs, when these IDs are not supported by a Service. 
  * Kenny add substantive comments to issue tracker.
  * Kenny inform the owner of a substantive comment once the comment has been addressed.
  * Simon to add the minOccurs and maxOccurs tweak to the tweaks page.

== Agenda/Minutes ==

=== soap faults ===

Kenny: Consensus check: Is everyone happy with leaving the spec as is in terms of soap faults, or would people prefer that the spec explicitly state that a Service must use the client and server soap fault classes in accordance with ws-i basic profile 1.1?   

=== Issues ===

==== Issue 216 ====

Geoff: We should spell out the steps that should be taken to synchronize content
in an out-of-band selection model.  This would be informative.

==== Issue 217 =====

Johan: in bookmark-2005-1.xsd we should refer to the canonical URI of xml.xsd
instead of a local copy

Kenny: there is already an action item on me to change the local xsds to their cononical identifiers. given that the pdtb2 folks have now published the changes on the DC website, perhaps now is a good time to make this change? 


==== Issue 218 ====

Johan: according to 
http://www.daisy.org/z3986/2005/Z3986-2005.html#li_440

lastmark element doesn't contain any attributes while in the bookmark
schema we have defined a label attribute
 


==== Issue 219 ====

Johan: according to the [ChangeLog]
ncxRef and charOffset has been changed from
empty complex types to xs:stringS while they are defined as xs:anyURI and
xs:long in the schema

Geoff: This is a problem with the [ChangeLog],
not the schema.

==== Issue 220 ====

Johan: the "bookmark" and "KeyExchange" schemas are imported in do-types-10.xsd
although we don't refer to any elements in these schemas from it
 
==== Issue 221 ====

Johan: no types have been defined for 
  * contentMetadata/metadata/meta@name
  * contentMetadata/metadata/meta@content
   * contentMetadata@category
 
I suggest we assign a type for these. depending on the use we can choose
between xs:string, xs:anySimpleType, or xs:anyType

==== Issue 222 ====

Johan: as of now the keyRing element is top-level element although it's no longer
a top-level element

Geoff: Let's not.  It's a wart, but it works fine as-is.

==== Issue 223 ====

Johan: should we make a note that the service must include the firstItem and
lastItem attributes in a response when the RS request a partial content list
 
==== Issue 224 ====

Johan: This proposal is to add an indicator so that service providers can
distinguish between downloading and streaming devices.

Johan: There are currently no means for a service provider to distinguish between
downloading and streaming devices. As a service provider, if I have many users
simultaneously trying to retrieve a content, I would like to redirect streaming
devices to a server where where bandwidth is available while downloading devices are
directed to a server where they all have to share the available bandwidth.
 
This might not be a requirement for the protocol but would make a nice feature for
service providers.
 
A solution to address this feature would be to add an parameter to the
getContentResources operation indicating what the RS is intending to do.
 
E.g. getContentResources("some id", "stream")
 
geoff: This is a duplicate of 
 issue 94 .

==== Issue 225 ====

Johan: In Section 4.4.1 Content Retrieval Sequence, the first operation is:
 
"1. The  getContentMetadata   operation must be called to obtain
information about the Content. The returned metadata includes publication
information, file format and size and may include the return status and date."
 
- return status is required
- contentMetadata does not contain a date attribute anymore and should be
removed
