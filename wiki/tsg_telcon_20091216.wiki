=== Issues ===

==== Issue 93 ====

markus: There is an i18n issue with the label/text element. This needs to support
at least inline markup for xml:lang, directionality, bdo, and optimally
also ruby. One solution is to allow a subset of XHTML1.1 inline in this
context.

Markus: Out of scope?  Need at least xml:lang, dir attributes on label element.

==== Issue 142 ====

Markus: We have 
-serviceAttributes/supportedOptionalOperations/operation/DYNAMIC_MENUS that
declares if a Service supports dynamic menus *in general*
- serviceAttributes/supportsServerSideBack which is a subset of the above
- serviceAttributes/supportsSearch which is a subset of the above
- serviceAttributes/supportedContentSelectionModels/BROWSE which *almost*
but not entirely overlaps with supportsSearch (BROWSE could be fulfilled by
other means than collection searching facilities, eg exposing precomposed
contentLists through the menus)

Although I cant see that the above is broken per se, it could be expressed
in a more easy to grok form.

==== Issue 184 ====

Matt: Clarify fault documentation re email inquiry:

Where and how
should the invalidOperation be integrated in the SOAP fault? Should it
appear as a child element in the detail element of the fault element or
should it be a string representing the faultcode of the fault element or
what?
 
==== Issue 186 ====

Geoff: Since returnContent is an optional operation, it should be declared in a
Service's <serviceAttributes>.  However, it's missing from the list of
allowed values for <operation>.

==== Issue 187 ====

Geoff: The localized, plain language error messages requirement says that error
messages should be localized.
 
http://code.google.com/p/daisy-online-delivery/wiki/RequirementsDocument#Localized,_plain_language_error_messages
 
If we're going to localize them, then we should probably have an optional
xml:lang attribute on the <reason> subelement (<faultstrings> already have
this, via WS-i).

==== Issue 188 ==== 

Matt: Using empty complexType definitions for ncxRef, etc. is causing problems 
with some tools. There appears to be no reason why the using @type to 
specify a simpler type wouldn't work instead.

==== Issue 190 ====

kenny: Do we need to specify a value for soap actions in the wsdl to cater for 
development tools that do not accept empty soap action values?
 
Proposal 1: Do not specify a value. (no change required)
 
Proposal 2: Specify a relative value i.e. "/getServiceAttributes"

==== Issue 191 ==== 

Kenny: Currently, the spec  does not provide a test suite. Lack of a test suite 
may lead to interoperability issues.

==== Issue 194 ====

Geoff: 4.4.4.3. Accessing PDTB2 Content says, "If the Service does not have any of
the keys or if the User is not authorized to access the Content, then the
Service must reply with an invalidOperation fault."  This should be
invalidParameter instead, to be consistent with other operations.  The
problem is that the User did not supply the correct parameters (missing
keys, unauthorized keys).

==== Issue 195 ====

geoff: What fault should getContentResources return if it is called for Content
that is not issued?  invalidOperation or invalidParameter?  The docs say
the call is invalid if the Content is not issued.  However, the operation
itself could be valid, but the wrong Content ID was used.
