Johan:

As a content provider I want to withdraw (remove) an issued content from a user and the user (or the RS) should return the content the next time is logs on to the service.

I know that PDTB2 is the solution, but if the users only can stream content then I as a service provider can permit access to issued content. This could for example be used in a case where the user pays an annual (or monthly or weekly) fee to access content, and when to user forgets to pay this fee, then I can permit access to content but still let him use the service, perhaps he could find a personal announcement reminding him to pay the fee...
