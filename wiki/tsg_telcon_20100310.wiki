  * geoff add informative verbiage to the spec that outlines the steps that need to be taken to synchronise content in an  out-of-band selection model. 
  * kenny add a feature request to the Daisy Issue Tracker for the next version of the spec that will enable a service to determine whether a Reading system intends to download or stream content, and close Issue 224.
  * Johan and Kenny advice Nick on what sections he should work on in the Interoperability Testing document. 
  * Johan, Nick and kenny work on the Interoperability testing document before the next telecon to produce the first draft.
  * Kenny add a feature request to the Daisy Issue Tracker to provide the summary of Recommendations document, accompanied with a summary of Requirements, in the maintenance phase of the spec. 
  * Geoff eliminate the ambiguity around the use of the word "Content" in the spec, and close Issue 211.     
  * Simon, Jelle, Johan, Geoff and Hiro implement pdtb2 support in their test implementations by 8 March. *Johan: done* 
  * Kenny add a normative assertion, that sets forth the invalidParameter fault as the consequence of a Reading System calling the getQuestions operation with the "back" id when no prior call to the getQuestions operation has been made in the active session, to the spec and the Interoperability testing documents.
  * Kenny add a normative assertion, that sets forth the invalidParameter fault as the consequence of a Reading System calling the getQuestions operation with the "back" and "search" IDs, when these IDs are not supported by a Service. 
  * Kenny add substantive comments to issue tracker.
  * Kenny inform the owner of a substantive comment once the comment has been addressed.
  * Simon to add the minOccurs and maxOccurs tweak to the tweaks page.
  * Markus fix the &apos; entity problem. (outstanding; bug in IE.) (Markus will fix this when ready to publish.)

== Agenda/Minutes ==

=== Issues ===

==== Issue 227 ====

Jelle: The spec mentions: "A return value of false or an issued fault both indicate that the operation was not 
successful."
So any other response could actually mean that the reading system is still logged in.
I do not think this is acceptable/useful for a logOff command, and could confuse the reading system.
 
logOff should return true after a successful logOn (regardless of any other commands)
logOff should throw noActiveSessionFault if the RS was already logged off
 
==== Issue 228 ====

Geoff: The first note in section 3.1 says, "An established HTTP session is not in
itself a valid indicator that a Reading System has successfully logged on
to the Service ...."
 
But a session isn't established until a successful logOn.  I'm pretty sure
this note is incorrect or out-of-date.

==== Issue 229 ====

If markAnnouncementsAsRead is called with multiple ids, and one of those ids 
is invalid, it is not exactly clear/defined what should happen.
I guess, the function should at return "invalidParameterFault" as one of the 
parameters is invalid, but then the service should not mark any of the other 
messages as read.
Might it not be simpler to just limit the operation to one message at a 
time.
