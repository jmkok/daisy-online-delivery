#summary List of changes to the specification.

= From the Trial Use Draft to Current =

This is an aggregation of all the changes to the protocol made since the Draft for Trial Use (r566) was released 27 September 2009.  The current revision as of this writing is r724.

== API ==

Changes to `do-wsdl-10.wsdl`:

  * All `soap:operation`s now have the `soapAction` attribute set to `"/operationName"`.
  * Added note that `returnContent` must never return `false`, only `true` or a fault.
  * Changed the `firstItem` and `lastItem` arguments to `getContentList` from unbounded `integer`s to 32-bit `int`s.
  * Added the `invalidOperation` fault to the signatures of `logOff` and `getContentMetadata`.
  * Calling `getKeyExchangeObject` with unauthorized keys in the `keyRing` results in an `invalidParameter` fault, not `invalidOperation`.

== Types ==

Changes to `do-types-10.xsd`:

  * Moved `contentMetadata@returnBy` to `resources@returnBy`. This means the Reading System does not need to check getContentMetadata both before and after issuance, and that `@returnBy` is not displayed before issuance. Added note that the attribute may not change while the Content is issued.
  * Changed `label/audio@rangeBegin`, `@rangeEnd` and `@size` from unbounded `integer`s to 64-bit `long`s.
  * Changed `contentMetadata/metadata/size` from an unbounded `integer` to a 64-bit `long`.
  * Changed `resource@size` from an unbounded `integer` to a 64-bit `long`.
  * Changed `contentList@totalItems`, `firstItem` and `lastItem` from unbounded `integer`s to 32-bit `int`s.
  * Allowed unlimited `contentMetadata/metadata/narrator`s, not just one.

== Documentation ==

  * Added recommendation that menu state be retained for the duration of the session.

== Pending ==

These changes are due to be made before the release of the final version:

  # A note to be made that audio notes are specifically not supported. (Action: kenny)
  # Record that @xml:lang is required on the label type and @dir is optional on label/text. (Action: Markus)
  # Modify the bookmark xsd to eliminate empty complex types. (Action: kenny)
