#summary List of changes to the specification.

= From the Trial Use Draft to Current =

This is an aggregation of all the changes made since the Draft for Trial Use (r566) was released 27 September 2009.  The current revision as of this writing is r665.

== API ==

Changes to `do-wsdl-10.wsdl`:

  * Changed the `firstItem` and `lastItem` arguments to `getContentList` from unbounded `integer`s to 32-bit `int`s.
  * Added the `invalidOperation` fault to the signatures of `logOff` and `getContentMetadata`.
  * Calling `getKeyExchangeObject` with unauthorized keys in the `keyRing` results in an `invalidParameter` fault, not `invalidOperation`.

== Types ==

Changes to `do-types-10.xsd`:

  * Changed `label/audio@rangeBegin`, `@rangeEnd` and `@size` from unbounded `integer`s to 64-bit `long`s.
  * Changed `contentMetadata/metadata/size` from an unbounded `integer` to a 64-bit `long`.
  * Changed `resource@size` from an unbounded `integer` to a 64-bit `long`.
  * Changed `contentList@totalItems`, `firstItem` and `lastItem` from unbounded `integer`s to 32-bit `int`s.
  * Allowed unlimited `contentMetadata/metadata/narrator`s, not just one.

  # A recommendation to be added to the spec that state information should only be held for the duration of a session. (Action: Kenny)

  # Add the normative assertion that Services must not change the value of the returnBy attribute once the getContentResources operation has been called once to the documentation and the test suite. (Action: Geoff)
  # Clarify the verbiage for segmented contentList(s). (Action: Geoff)
  # Document that returnContent should never return false in the documentation and test suite. (Action: Kenny)
  # Record that @xml:lang is required on the label type and @dir is optional on label/text. (Action: Markus)
  # Make a note in the spec that the fault types defined in the wsdl must be child elements of the details element of the soap:fault element. (Action: Geoff)
  # Modify the bookmark xsd to eliminate empty complex types. (Action: kenny)
  # Add relative values for soap actions as per proposal 2 to the wsdl. (Action: kenny)
