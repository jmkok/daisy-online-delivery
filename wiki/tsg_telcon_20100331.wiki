=== Issues ===

==== Issue 237 ====

Jelle: Currently you can only return a content list ref.
I think it would be essential that the getQuestion can return a list of 
resource ids.

This will ease up enormously on search and other functionality where 
currently the content list is just a huge burden which always needs to be 
placed in between...
Â 
==== Issue 238 ====

Geoff: Currently the model for an inputQuestion allows zero or one inputTypes
children.  Shouldn't there always be one inputTypes child?

==== Issue 239 ====

Jelle: getContentList with unsatisfiable ranges should return an empty list and not throw an invalidParameter. 
The invalidParameter should only be thrown if the ID is invalid.

examples:
- getContentList("new",5000,6000)
  return an list with totalItems set to 0
- getContentList("-non-existing-",5000,6000)
  throws an invalidParameter

You might argue with the first example, however take the following example into account..
Throwing an invalidParameter would generate issues with the following examples:
- getContentList("new",0,6000)
  invalidParemeeter or return the amount of items ?!?!
- getContentList("new",100,6000) on a list of exactly 100 items !!!
  invalidParemeeter or return an empty list ?!?!

==== Issue 240 ====

Johan (paraphrased): Remove the noActiveSession fault from logOff.

=== Test suite Progress review ===

==== [http://code.google.com/p/daisy-online-delivery/wiki/ProtocolSystemTesting Systems Testing] ====

  * Status of the Systems Testing report  

=== Consensus Check ===

  * Do we have consensus to submit the Daisy Online spec to the Daisy Board for endorsement as a Technical recommendation of the Daisy consortium with: 
   * The spec documentation in the svn as it stands right now.
   * the System Testing report as it stands right now. 

=== Submission logisstics ===

Kenny: I will post the formal submission document with Geoff's systems testing report to the Daisy Online mailing list a few hours after this call seeking the approval of wg members. If there are no objections posted to the list within 24 hours, the submission will be sent to Bernhard for the Daisy board. Is everyone happy with this course of action?
