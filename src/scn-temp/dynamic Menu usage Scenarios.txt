1. Usage Scenario: How to use the dynamic menu feature to retrieve the Main Menu from a Service.

The Reading System retrieves the Main Menu of the Service by invoking the getQuestions operation with the reserved id "default" by passing in the following parameter: 

<userResponses>
<userResponse id="default"/>
</userResponses>

getQuestions(userResponses)

The operation returns the following questions type:
 
<questions>
<multipleChoiceQuestion id="q1">

<label xml:lang="en">
<text>What would you like to do?</text>
</label>

<choices>
<choice id="c1">
<label>
<text>Search the Library</text>
</label>
</choice>

<choice id="c2">
<label>
<text>Update your profile</text>
</label>
</choice>

<choice id="c3">
<label>
<text>Take a Survey</text>
</label>
</choice>

<choice id="c4">
<label>
<text>Buy a book</text>
</label>
</choice>

<choice id="c5">
<label>
<text>Download or Stream content</text>
</label>
</choice>
</choices>
</multipleChoiceQuestion>
</questions>

<tip> Each userResponse element contains the user's response to a particular question. There are three reserved ids that have a special meaning:
1. default - returns the question that comprises the Main Menu.
2. search - Returns the question that comprises the search menu.
3. back - Returns the previous question.     

A question can be a multiple choice question (<multipleChoiceQuestion>), or a question that can receive a numeric text, alfanumeric text or audio response from the user (<inputQuestion>). If the userResponse element is being used to encapsulate the user's response to a multiple choice question, the id attribute of the userResponse element contains the  same value as the id attribute of the corresponding multipleChoiceQuestion element, and the value attribute of the userResponse element contains the same value as the id attribute of the choice element that the user selected. If the userResponse element is being used to encapsulate the user's response to a question that receives numeric text, alfanumeric text or an audio response, the id attribute of the userResponse element contains the same value as the id attribute of the corresponding inputQuestion element, and the value attribute of the userResponse element contains:
1. The numeric or alfanumeric text that the user entered if the question receives a numeric or alfanumeric response.
2. An empty string or omitted altogether if the question receives an audio response.    

If the question receives an audio response, the audio response is base 64 encoded and encapsulated in the data child element of the userResponse element. </tip>

<tip> The values assigned to the id attributes of the inputQuestion, multipleChoiceQuestion and choice elements in all the examples listed in this section are arbitrary. These ids are defined in the Daisy Online xsd as the xsd id type, and thus can take any unique value.</tip>

The Reading system renders this type to the user in the following way:

What Would you like to do?
* Search the Library
* Update your profile
* Take a Survey.
* Buy a book
* Download or Stream content

2. Usage Scenario: How to use the Dynamic Menu feature to enable a user to perform Search.  

As Search is envisaged to be a very important part of the Online Distribution of content, and thus the Reading Systems may have specific user interface components to invoke search, a special id is available and can be passed into the getQuestions operation to retrieve the menu specific to search.

<userResponses>
<userResponse id="search"/>
</userResponses>

<tip>

Using the aforementioned Main Menu example, if the user selects "Search the Library," the following userResponses type could also be used to retrieve the Search menu:     

<userResponses>
<userResponse id="q1" value="c1"/>
</userResponses>

The reserved Search id thus, is a shortcut provided for those Reading systems that have explicit user interface components for invoking the Search feature.

</tip>

getQuestions ( userResponses)

The operation returns the following questions type:
 
<questions>
<multipleChoiceQuestion id="q2">

<label xml:lang="en">
<text>What would you like to Search by?</text>  
</label>

<choices>
<choice id="c1">
<label>
<text>Title</text>
</label>
</choice>

<choice id="c2">
<label>
<text>Author</text>
</label>
</choice>

<choice id="c3">
<label>
<text>Genre</text>
</label>
</choice>

</choices>
</multipleChoiceQuestion>
</questions>

The Reading System renders this type to the user as follows:
 
what would you like to search by?
* title
* author
* Genre

Assuming that the user selects "Author," the reading system retrieves the next menu by passing in the following parameter to the getQuestions operation:    

<userResponses>
<userResponse id="q2" value="c1"/>
</userResponses>

getQuestions(userResponses)

This operation returns the following type:
  
<questions>
<inputQuestion id="q2-1">

<inputTypes>
<input type="text_numeric"/>
<input type="text_alphanumeric"/>
</inputTypes>

<label xml:lang="en">
<text>Please enter the name of the Author.</text>
</label>

</inputQuestion>
</questions>

 The Reading System renders this type to the user as follows:

Please enter the name of the author. 

Assuming the user entered the name "J.K. Rawling," the Reading System invokes the getQuestions operation with the following parameter:

<userResponses>
<userResponse id="q2-1" value="J.K. Rawling"/>
</userResponses>

this operation returns the following questions type:

<questions>

<contentListRef>l100</contentListRef>

</questions>

the reading system extracts the id of the contentList from the contentListRef element, and invokes the getContentList operation as follows:
  
getContentList("l100", 1, 20)

<tip>

the getContentList operation takes the following three parameters:
1. id - this is the ID of the contentList type that is being requested.
2. firstItem - this is the index of the first contentItem within the contentList type.     
3. lastItem - this is the index of the last contentItem within the contentList type.

getContentList("l100", 1, 20) thus requests the contentList type with the id "l100," and specifies that the first contentItem returned should be at index 1 and the last contentItem returned should be at index 20 (i.e. the first 20 contentItem elements) in the contentList type. 

the firstItem and lastItem parameters exist to enable the reading system to request a contentList type with a specified number of contentItem child elements, in situations where memory or bandwidth constraints may not permit the retrieval of an entire contentList.

</tip>              

the operation returns the following contentList type:

<contentList id="l100" firstItem="1" lastItem="20" totalItems="20">

<label xml:lang="en">
<text>Your Search for "J.K. Rawling" returned the following results.</text>
</label>

<contentItem id="hp_cos" lastModifiedDate="2009-08-20T11:00:00Z">

<label>
<text>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets
</label>
</contentItem>

<contentItem id="hp_dh" lastModifiedDate="2009-08-22T08:00:00Z">

<label>
<text>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows
</label>
</contentItem>

<contentItem id="hp_gof" lastModifiedDate="2009-08-04T14:30:00Z">

<label>
<text>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire
</label>
</contentItem>

</contentList>

The Reading System renders this type as follows:

Your Search for "J.K. Rawling" returned the following results:  
* harry potter and chamber of secrets
* harry potter and deathly hallows
* harry potter and goblet of fire

When a Service returns a contentListRef child element within a questions type,, the Reading system is logically at the end of the Service's dynamic menu. the reading system extracts the id of the contentList from the contentListRef elementt as illustrated above, and invokes the getContentList operation to retrieve the contentList.      

The Reading System may then retrieve information about the specific contentItems in the contentList type by invoking the getContentMetadata operation, passing in the id of the particular content item.   At this stage, the Reading system may ask the user whether he/she wishes to Download or Stream content. If the user wishes to download/stream content, the Reading system calls the issueContent operation passing in the id of the particular content item, followed by a call to the getContentResources operation, to request issuance and retrieve the uris of the resources that constitute the particular content item respectively.      

<tip>

the contentMetadata type returned by the getContentMetadata operation may contain a sample child element. for example:

<contentMetadata>

...

<sample id="hp_gof_sample"/>

...

</contentMetadata>

the reading system invokes the getContentResources operation passing in the id of the sample (in this example hp_gof_sample) to retrieve the resources that constitute the sample. the Daisy Online Protocol does not require a call to the issueContent operation if the getContentResources operation is being called to retrieve the resources for a sample. Put another way, issuance of a sample through a call to the issueContent opeeration is not required by the Daisy online protocol.

</tip>          

3. Usage Scenario: How to use the Dynamic menu feature to enable a user to update his/her profile. 

Using the aforementioned Main Menu example, if the user selects "update your profile," the Reading System invokes the getQuestions operation with the following parameter:  

<userResponses>
<userResponse id="q1" value="c3"/>
</userResponses>

getQuestions(userResponses)

this operation returns the following type:

<questions>
<inputQuestion id="q3-1">

<inputTypes>
<input type="text_numeric"/>
<input type="text_alphanumeric"/>
</inputTypes>

<label xml:lang="en">
<text>Your Name</text> 
</label>

</inputQuestion>

<inputQuestion id="q3-2">

<inputTypes>
<input type="text_numeric"/>
<input type="text_alphanumeric"/>
</inputTypes>

<label xml:lang="en">
<text>Your Address</text>
</label>

</inputQuestion>

<multipleChoiceQuestion id="q3-3">

<label xml:lang="en">
<text>Your Gender</text>
</label>

<choices>
<choice id="c1">
<label>
<text>Male</text>
</label>
</choice>

<choice id="c2">
<label>
<text>Female</text>
</label>
</choice>

</choices>
</multipleChoiceQuestion>
</questions>

The Reading system renders this type as follows:

Your name:

Your Address: 

Your Gender
*Male
* female

After the user responds to the questions, the Reading System invokes the getQuestions operation passing in the following parameter:

<userResponses>
<userResponse id="q3-1" value="firstname lastname"/>
<userResponse id="q3-2" value="street number, suburb, city, state postal code, country"/>
<userResponse id="q3-3" value="c2"/>
</userResponses>
 
This operation returns the following type: 

<questions>

<label xml:lang="en">
<text>Your profile has been updated successfully! </text>
</label>

</questions>

The Reading system renders this type to the user as follows:

Your profile has been updated successfully!

As in the case of the Service returning a contentListRef hchild element within a questions type, if the Service returns a label child element in the questions type, the Reading System is logically at the end of the    Service's dynamic menu. 

<tip> 

If the Service intends to take the user back to a previous menu after a message such as "your profile has been updated successfully," the Service returns a multipleChoiceQuestion element within the questions type as follows:

<questions>
<multipleChoiceQuestion id="q3-4">

<label xml:lang="en">
<text>Your profile has been updated successfully! What would you like to do next?</text>
</label>

<choices>
<choice id="c1">
<label>
<text>Reenter your profile information</text>
</label>
</choice>

<choice id="c2">
<label>
<text>Go back to the previous menu</text>
</label>
</choice>

</choices>
</multipleChoiceQuestion>  
</questions>

</tip>

4. Usage Scenario: How to use the dynamic menu feature to enable a user to take a survey, where the user can respond to one of the questions with an audio answer.     

Using the aforementioned Main Menu example, if the user selects "Take a Survey", the Reading System invokes the getQuestions operation passing in the following parameter:     

<userResponses>
<userResponse id="q1" value="c3" />
</userResponses>

getQuestions(userResponses)

This operation returns the following type:

<questions>
<inputQuestion id="q4-1">

<inputTypes>
<input type="text_numeric"/>
<input type="text_alphanumeric"/>
</inputTypes>

<label xml:lang="en">
<text>What is your favourite feature in the Service?</text>
</label>

</inputQuestion>

<multipleChoiceQuestion id="q4-2">

<label xml:lang="en">
<text>On a scale of one to four, where four is very satisfied and 1 is not satisfied, how would you rate the Service?</text>
</label>

<choices>
<choice id="c1">
<label>
<text>1</text>
</label>
</choice>

<choice id="c2">

</multipleChoiceQuestion>

<inputQuestion id="q4-3">

<inputTypes>
<input type="audio" />
</inputTypes>

<label xml:lang="en">
<text>Please provide feedback on the Service.</text>
</label>

</inputQuestion>
</questions>

The Reading system renders this type as follows:

What is your favourite feature in the Service?:

On a scale of one to four, where four is very satisfied and 1 is not satisfied, how would you rate the Service?
* 1
* 2
* 3
* 4

Please provide feedback on the Service.:

After the user responds to the questions, the Reading System invokes the getQuestions operation passing in the following parameter:

<userResponses>
<userResponse id="q4-1" value="favourite feature"/>
<userResponse id="q4-2" value="c3"/>
<userResponse id="q4-3">
<data>zkgfhklj3~#$jkl*!</data> 
</userResponse>
</userResponses>

getQuestions(userResponses)

This operation returns the following type:

<questions>
<multipleChoiceQuestion id="q4-4">

<label xml:lang="en">
<text>thank you for taking the Survey. What would you like to do next?</text>
</label>

<choices>
<choice id="c1">

<text>Go back to the Main Menu</text>
</label>
</choice>

</choices>
</multipleChoiceQuestion>  
</questions>

The Reading System renders this type as follows:

Thank you for taking the Survey! What would you like to do next?
* Take another Survey.
* Go back to the previous menu. 
* Go back to the Main Menu

5. usage Scenario: How to use the Dynamic menu feature to enable a user to Buy a book.

Using the aforementioned Main Menu example, if the user selects "Buy a Book," the Reading System invokes the getQuestions operation passing in the following parameter:

<userResponses>
<userResponse id="q1" value="c4"/>
</userResponses>
  
getQuestions(userResponses)

This operation returns the following type:

<questions>
<multipleChoiceQuestion id="q5" allowMultipleSelections="true">

<label xml:lang="en">
<text>Which of the following book(s) would you like to buy?</text>
</label>

<choices>
<choice id="c1">
<label>
<text>Harry Potter and the chamber of secrets</text>
</label>
</choice>

<choice id="c2">

</choice>

<choice id="c4">
<label>
<text>Harry Potter and the half-blood Prince</text>
</label>
</choice>

<choice id="c5">
<label>
<text>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</text>
</label>
</choice>
</choices>
</multipleChoiceQuestion>
</questions>

<tip>

The allowMultipleSelections attribute of the multipleChoiceQuestion element tells the reading System whether a user should be allowed to select multiple answers from the list of choices.

When the user's answers are encapsulated in a userResponses type by the Reading system for a multiple choice question that allows multiple selections, each userResponse element holds information about a single selection. So if the user selected three choices out of a list of five choices, the userResponses type would contain three distinct userResponse child elements that hold information about the three choices that the user selected. This is illustrated in the userResponses type below.      
</tip>

The Reading System renders this type as follows:

Which of the following book(s) would you like to buy? 
* Harry Potter and the chamber of secrets
* Harry Potter and the deathly hallows
* Harry Potter and the goblet of fire
* Harry Potter and the half-blood Prince
* Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix

(Assuming that the user selects choices 2, 3 and 5)

The Reading system invokes the getQuestions operation passing in the following parameter:

<userResponses>
<userResponse id="q5" value="c2"/>
<userResponse id="q5" value="c3"/>
<userResponse id="q5" value="c5"/>
</userResponses>

getQuestions(userResponses)

This operation returns the following type:

<questions>
<multipleChoiceQuestion id="q5-1">
