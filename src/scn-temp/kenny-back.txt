Back feature

Assuming that we invoked the search menu by calling getQuestions with a single userResponse which has id = search or, from the Main Menu example with id = 100 and Value = 101.

At any stage in the ensuing questions (aka menus), the previous menu can be retrieved by calling getquestions with a userResponses type that contains id="back"

(the Reading system would make the following function call) 
getQuestions(100 101 or search)

(the Service would return the following response) 
[mcq ms=no] 200
what would you like to search by?
201 title
202 author

(Assuming the user selected 202 author, the reading system would make the following function call)  
getQuestions(200, 202)

(the service would return the following response)
[q]
please enter the author's name

(Assuming that the user now pushes the back button on the reading system to change the search category, the reading system would make the following function call)  
getQuestions(back)

(The service would calculate what back is in this context, and send the following response)  
[mcq ms=no] 200
what would you like to search by?
201 title
202 author
